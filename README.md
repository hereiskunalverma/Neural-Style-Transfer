# Deep Learning & Art: Neural Style Transfer

This algorithm was created by [Gatys et al. (2015).](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576)

Neural Style Transfer (NST) is one of the most fun techniques in deep learning. As seen below, it merges two images, namely: a **"content" image (C) and a "style" image (S), to create a "generated" image (G**). 

The generated image G combines the "content" of the image C with the "style" of image S. 

In this example, we are going to generate an image of the Louvre museum in Paris (content image C), mixed with a painting by Claude Monet, a leader of the impressionist movement (style image S).

## - Transfer Learning

Neural Style Transfer (NST) uses a previously trained convolutional network, and builds on top of that. The idea of using a network trained on a different task and applying it to a new task is called transfer learning. 

Following the [original NST paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576), we will use the VGG network. Specifically, we'll use VGG-19, a 19-layer version of the VGG network. This model has already been trained on the very large ImageNet database, and thus has learned to recognize a variety of low level features (at the shallower layers) and high level features (at the deeper layers).
